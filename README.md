# appdev
Three week class on app development

# Cloning the project
1) clone the project
2) make sure that expo cli is installed if not then run "npm install -g expo-cli"
3) in the application folder run "npm install" to install all dependencies
4) to run linter "npm run lint", it's also great to use the [eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for vs code.
